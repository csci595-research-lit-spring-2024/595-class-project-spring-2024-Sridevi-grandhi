\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, our study presents a comprehensive evaluation of YOLO NAS models for automated blood cell identification and counting. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning-based object detection in streamlining the diagnostic process and improving the efficiency of blood cell analysis. Despite the challenges posed by varying hyperparameters and resource constraints, our findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in revolutionizing medical diagnostics. 

\section{Future work}
This section should refer to Chapter~\ref{ch:results} where the author has reflected their criticality about their own solution. The future work is then sensibly proposed in this section.

\textbf{Guidance on writing future work:} While working on a project, you gain experience and learn the potential of your project and its future works. Discuss the future work of the project in technical terms. This has to be based on what has not been yet achieved in comparison to what you had initially planned and what you have learned from the project. Describe to a reader what future work(s) can be started from the things you have completed. This includes identifying what has not been achieved and what could be achieved. 



A good future work summary could be approximately 300--500 words long, but this is just a recommendation.
